If data has been collected, you will see strings with the format:
`MC:BASE64_ENCODED_CHUNK:` in the dump.

:::note

It's perfectly fine for other logs to be interleaved with the exported data.

:::

For example:

```
shell> reboot
[00:00:01] INFO: System Booting!
[00:00:02] INFO: Memfault Build ID: d8d6a047282f025fffa29fa767100f310bc40f80
shell> trace
# CLI command making a call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`
shell> export
[00:00:10] INFO: MC:SFQCpwIBAwEHalRFU1RTRVJJQUwKbXRlc3Qtc29mdHdhcmUJajEuMC4wLXRlcw==:
```

Copy the logs from the console, navigate to the "Chunks Debug" view for your
project, and paste the logs:

![](/binary-assets/embedded/copy-paste-chunks-ui.png)

Select "Next" to review the chunks that were identified and (optionally) update
the "Device Serial" being used to report data:

![](/binary-assets/embedded/post-chunks-ui.png)

Select "Post" to submit the chunks to Memfault. The chunks will appear in the
view directly below. Check and make sure there are no "Errors" to address.
