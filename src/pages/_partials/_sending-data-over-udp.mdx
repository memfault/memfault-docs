Memfault servers do not accept UDP transfers. To transfer data from a device
that can send UDP datagrams (such as the
[nRF9160](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/samples/nrf9160/udp/README.html)),
an additional server is necessary to act as a relay between the device and
Memfault servers.

A
[working sample of a complete set-up can be found here](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-nRF9160-relay).
It features a Python UDP server that relays data to Memfault, and a firmware
implementation that includes a UDP client. The device and the Python server use
a simple binary encoding format that includes the following sections, separated
by a `NULL` byte:

- A version section identifying the encoding format for forward compatibility.
- A Project Key.
- The device serial.
- The Memfault chunk.

This configuration allows for a simple, stateless UDP server that just passes
data over to Memfault.
