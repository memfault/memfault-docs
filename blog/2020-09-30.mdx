## Memfault Firmware Update CDN

Memfault now supports serving firmware update payloads for Android devices using
our [Bort SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort). These payloads can be large,
coming in betweeen 1-3GB.

Because of this, serving these files out AWS S3 directly was too slow. So we now
have support for serving these files through a global CDN!

In our tests, devices can see 50MB/s download speeds from the CDN, so your
customers should experience quick firmware updates.

For more information, check out our
[Android OTA documentation](https://mflt.io/android-ota-updates).
