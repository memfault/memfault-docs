## Reboot Reason Tracking

Memfault will now show an overview of why devices in your fleet are rebooting.
If a project implements the
[Reboot Reason Tracking](https://mflt.io//reboot-reasons) module, Memfault will
show this information in the main dashboard.

## General Improvements

- We've had a couple of requests to allow for more fine-grained control of which
  firmware binaries devices with a cohort are given to install.

  It is now possible to bypass Memfault's built-in version checking and allow
  devices to download firmwares which our system detects as a "downgrade."

    />
  </p>

  You can find this setting under the Cohort Settings page.

- Added `revision` field to the `SoftwareVersion` API to allow users to store
  the revision of the VCS commit. For more information, check out our
  [API docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?version=latest#850ef085-cce1-4b78-9052-9146c8ba02fb).

## Embedded

- Improve usability of the HTTP libraries to query for OTA payloads hosted on
  Memfault.

  application identifiers. You can find these settings under the Project
