</p>

The default landing page is now a Project Dashboard! Here, you'll find
information such as:

- Top and Newest Issues
- Number of Traces, Bug Reports, and new Issues recently received
- The Software Version distribution
- Count of active Devices
- Number of Devices seen each day

These dashboards are filterable by Cohort. This gives you the ability to filter
the data to only internal or external devices, or to a particular customer.

  Versions, Symbol Files, and OTA Payloads.

- You can now generate and reset User API key's from within the Project Settings
  page. You can use the User API Key to do things like log in from the
  [Memfault CLI](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli/).

## Embedded

- The Issue Detail's page will show a pop-up if Memfault detects the symbol file
  and the coredump are not from the same build.

    />
  </p>
- Memfault's backend now accepts GNU Build IDs and
  [Memfault's own Build Identifier](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/build_info.h#L8-L42).
  The latter works with **any** compiler, such as GCC, ARM Compiler, IAR, Keil,
  etc.
- Improve reliability of coredump processing

## Android

- Memfault has a new
  [Memfault Bug Report SDK for AOSP](https://github.com/memfault/bort), or Bort,
  that assists with capturing and reporting diagnostic data to Memfault. For
  more information, check out the
  [Android Documentation](https://docs.memfault.com/docs/android/introduction)
- Zooming into a Bug Report's Timeline has been improved. You can now view the
  different sessions start and end points as well.
