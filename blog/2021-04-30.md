## Device Filtering Improvements

Customers have been asking for a way to "Drill-down" into some of the dashboards that we present on our Overview page. Today's the day! Starting with the **Reboots** chart, a user can click and view which devices make up the data. This allows you to easily see how many and which devices are experiencing reboots in the field.

</p>

Along with this, we've enabled more advanced device filtering, which allows users to filter by device serial, device nickname, Software Version, Cohort, Hardware Version, and when they last experienced a Reboot.

We've also made it easier to move multiple devices into a specific Cohort. By checking multiple devices in the list and clicking **Change Cohort**, those devices will all be immediately assigned to the new Cohort.

Be on the lookout for more improvements in this area coming soon!

## General

- **Project Onboarding Improvements:** To help customers maximize the full potential of Memfault, we've created Complete Project Setup page which will guide you through various steps of a complete integration with the Memfault service.

    </p>

  You can find this new page in the side bar under **Set up project**.

- Improve response time when loading the dashboards
- A user's email and API key can now be found by hovering over their name in the top right and selecting **Profile**.

## Real-Time

- **Viewing Device Logs in Memfault:** Memfault can now accept logs from MCU devices in the field.

    </p>

  We've added a new API, `memfault_log_trigger_collection`, which can be used to "freeze" the current contents of the log buffer when unexpected behavior takes place on the device. The logs can then be uploaded to Memfault and will appear in the Device's Timeline view. You can find more information in the [documentation](https://mflt.io/logging)

- Memfault will no longer show a "Symbols missing" banner for Software Versions that have been archived.
- Added support for collecting ARMv7-M MPU regions as part of coredump collection.
- Added several default heartbeat metrics to the Zephyr port around timer task stack usage and execution time.
