## Support for Complex Upgrade Paths

Many firmware projects have complex firmware upgrade paths. This might be to
enable binary differential updates to save bandwidth or maybe to allow for a
project to remove backwards-incompatible code.

For example, when upgrading a firmware from a 1.x to a 2.x release, the device
might need to go through a migration firmware as shown below.

    alt="must-pass-through"
  />
</p>

<!-- truncate -->

To use this, the [Memfault CLI](https://mflt.io/memfault-cli) provides a
`--must-pass-through` flag. The flag is also documented in the
[API docs](https://api-docs.memfault.com/?version=latest#8f4664ba-92cf-4b9d-bf07-89bfdacf11d4)

```
$ memfault upload-ota-payload --help
...
  --must-pass-through      When the release is deployed to a Cohort, forces a
                           device to update through this version even if a
                           newer version has also been deployed to the Cohort.
```

## General Improvements

- Improve usability of filtering for Issues, including the ability to search for
  Issues that affect a particular device.
- Improve usability of the Issue distributions when projects have many software
  versions.
- Fix a bug which would cause an Issue to have a "Last Seen" date in the future.

## Embedded

- When a Trace was received from a device but no symbol file has been uploaded
  for the corresponding firmware, Memfault will now show a warning in the Issues
  page.

    />
  </p>
- The Memfault CLI tool can now post a chunk that is encoded in base64, raw
  bytes, or was printed by the SDK through logs.

  ```
  $  memfault post-chunk --help
    Usage: memfault post-chunk [OPTIONS] DATA

    Sends data generated by the memfault-firmware-sdk ("chunks") to the
    Memfault cloud.

    The command can operate on binary data encoded in the following formats:

    1. Hex String:
      memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding hex 0802a702010301076a5445535453455249414c0a6d746573742d736f667477617265096a312e302e302d74657374066d746573742d686172647761726504a101a1726368756e6b5f746573745f737563636573730131e4

    2. Base64 Encoded String
      memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding base64 CAKnAgEDAQdqVEVTVFNFUklBTAptdGVzdC1zb2Z0d2FyZQlqMS4wLjAtdGVzdAZtdGVzdC1oYXJkd2FyZQShAaFyY2h1bmtfdGVzdF9zdWNjZXNzATHk

    3. Binary File
      memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding bin chunk_v2_single_chunk_msg.bin

    4. memfault-firmware-sdk data export
      memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding sdk_data_export data_export.txt
  ```

## Android

- Traces now show up within the Bug Report timeline view. Hover over each dot to
  see exact reason for failure.

- Add the ability to scrub the log data of personally identifiable information.
  You can find these settings under the Project Settings page.

- Improved Java exception parsing and de-duplication.

## Documentation

- The embedded [Reboot Reason Tracking guide](https://mflt.io//reboot-reasons)
  has been improved.
- A new page on [embedded logging](https://mflt.io/logging) has been created
  which shows how the SDK can be used to collect and show logs within the Issue
  view.
