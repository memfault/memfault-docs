## Custom Metric Dashboards

Memfault captures [heartbeat metrics](https://mflt.io/embedded-metrics) from
devices. These metrics can then be viewed on a per-device basis. Customers have
been asking for the ability to perform aggregates on these metrics over a fleet
of devices.

We are happy to say this feature is now available! Once a metric chart is
created, you can aggregate over the devices within a cohort or across a software
version.
