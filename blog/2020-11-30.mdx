## Logging Improvements

- Power up your log searching capabilities with filtering by log level, tags,
  regular expressions. This helps you find offending log lines faster than ever.
  Works for both Android and Real-Time products.

- Memfault now keeps track of which project members have viewed an Issue,
  allowing you to quickly check if and when your co-workers last looked at an
  issue. This helps to ensure that every is on the same page and no
  investigative work is duplicated.
