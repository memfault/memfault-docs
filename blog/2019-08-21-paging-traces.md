## Globals and Statics Viewer

If the traces that are created are full coredumps, then you have an **amazing**
new feature to use! It is now possible to view the device's **all** of the
global and static variable state at the time of trace capture **in the
browser**!

This, along with paging through traces, allows developers to quickly find
patterns between crashes and find root causes faster than ever. It's like having
a GDB prompt in the browser.

## Upgraded Trace Viewer

We've overhauled the backtrace viewer to more compactly show the various
threads, frames, and frame information of a Trace.

## Improved Register Viewer

Keeping with the trend, we've made the Register, Local variable, and Argument
viewer more beautiful and usable. For reference:

- `A` = arg
- `L` = local
- `R` = register

## Paging through Traces within an Issue

Some bugs take many occurrences to find patterns to really find out the root
cause. Memfault can now help with this as you can page through all of the
individual traces within an issue and see the different backtraces, variables,
and state when the device captured it's trace.

To use it, just click the arrows in the issue viewer.
