single Release on the Release Details page.

## Add Notes when Creating Releases

You can now add Notes under a Release when creating one. Use this field to add
mental notes about a particular Release or to use it for Release Notes to show
customers.

## Better Sorting and Filtering

It is now possible to sort Devices by **Device Serial** and **Last Seen**,
Releases by **Device Count**, and Events by **Device Serial** and **Captured
Date**.

## Register View in Trace Events

Memfault will now show the registers passed within a Trace Event in the
'Registers' card.
