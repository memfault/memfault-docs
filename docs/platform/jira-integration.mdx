This guide will cover how to set up the Jira Integration with Memfault so that a
user can quickly and easily create new Jira Issues from Memfault Issues.

## Edit Project Settings

The first thing to do is to navigate to the Memfault **Project Settings** page.
Under **General â†’ Integrations**, hover over "Add" and select **Atlassian
Jira**.

You should see the screen below.

  />
</p>

In each field, input the following:

### Instance URL

This is the URL of the Jira instance. If it is hosted by Jira, it is likely
_https://company-name.atlassian.net/_

### Parameters for `/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa`

- To find the Jira Project ID, or _pid_, you can follow the instructions
  [here](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/how-to-get-project-id-from-the-jira-user-interface-827341414.html).
- To find the Issue Type ID's, login to Jira in the browser and then navigate to
  `https://<jira-instance-id>/rest/api/3/issuetype` to find the ID's. When the
  response is returned, the desired field is labled `id`.

```json
{
  "self": "https://memfault.atlassian.net/rest/api/3/issuetype/10004",
  "id": "10004",
  "description": "A problem or error.",
  "iconUrl": "https://memfault.atlassian.net/secure/viewavatar?size=medium&avatarId=10303&avatarType=issuetype",
  "name": "Bug",
  "subtask": false,
  "avatarId": 10303
}
```

For example, if the above response was returned, `issuetype=10004` for a 'Bug'

## Create Test Issue

To ensure that everything works, you can click the **Create Test Issue** button.
It should navigate to a new Jira page with the Project, Issue Type, Summary, and
Description filled in.

</p>

## Create Jira Ticket From Memfault Issue

To try out the new integration, navigate to a pre-existing issue and look for
the new button in the top right of the Issue details page.
