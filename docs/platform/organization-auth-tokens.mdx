title: Organization Auth Tokens
---

Organization Auth Tokens allow access of the organization's resources
[for automation](/docs/ci/authentication#organization-auth-token). They can be
accessed and managed by Administrators at **Admin â†’ Organization Auth Tokens**.

:::note

If your organization enforces SSO, Organization Auth Tokens are the **only**
mechanism that allow to access organization resources through the API. User API
Keys will not work.

### Creation

Administrators can create new tokens via the **Create Token** button. They will
be prompted to enter an optional description. After that, they are shown the
token and should store it somewhere safe.

### Deletion

Administrators can delete tokens via the **Delete** button. Any automation (or
user) that uses that token will lose access.
