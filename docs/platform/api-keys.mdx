Memfault supports API keys as an authentication method. There are three types of API keys:

- User API keys
- Organization API keys
- Project keys

## Types of API Key

For CI, you'll want an Organization-scoped API key.

### Organization-scoped

Organization API keys can be managed by organization admins in the application under **Settings â†’ Organization API Keys**. Organization-scoped API keys can only access resources belonging to a specific organization.

### User API Keys

To generate a User API key, please read [the Auth section of our API documentation](https://api-docs.memfault.com/#authentication). Since users may belong to multiple organizations, User API keys give them access to all organizations of which they're a member.

### Project Keys

Project keys can be generated on demand. [Please contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com) if you'd like to have one.
