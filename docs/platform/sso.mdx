This guide covers Memfault's Single Sign-On (or SSO) offering. SSO allows users
of your organization to log in using your organization's third-party
authentication provider.

:::note

SSO on can be set up for organization on a per-request basis. We currently don't
support automatic or autonomous provisioning of SSO for organizations.
[Let us know](mailto:hello@memfault.com) if you'd like us to set you up.

:::

Supported providers include:

- Okta
- Google
- Azure AD
- Microsoft AD FS
- OneLogin
- VMware Workspace ONE

Memfault additionally supports logging in with SAML.

## Getting Started

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com) to enable Single Sign On for your
organization.

## Invite New Users

Members with an `@your-domain.com` email address will need an invitation to your
organization. Without one, they will be able to log in but they won't be members
of your organization, and will not have access to your organization's projects.

<InviteNewUsers />

External users will still be able to log in to Memfault with their email address
(even if it's not in `@your-domain.com`). If you'd like to restrict access to
members with a `@your-domain.com` email address,
[please contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com).

## Authenticating With SSO

### Logging Into the App

We have different methods depending on your authentication provider.

  />
</p>

#### Google

To log in with Google, simply click on the **Log in with Google** button. Make
sure you choose the account belonging to your organization, and you'll be
redirected back to the app automatically.

#### Other Providers & SAML

To log in with other providers and SAML, click on the **Log in with SAML SSO**
link, and you'll be prompted to enter your email address. Make sure to enter the
email address provided by your organization.

    src="/img/docs/platform/login-with-saml-form.png"
    alt="Memfault's log in form for SAML SSO"
  />
</p>

After successfully authenticating, you'll be redirected back to the app
automatically.

## SSO Enforcement

Please [contact us](mailto:hello@memfault.com) to enforce SSO usage for your
organization.

When your organization enforces SSO,
[User API keys](/docs/ci/authentication#user-api-key) will stop working, as they
can't be re-authenticated interactively.

In that case, your users will need to use
[Organization Auth Tokens](/docs/ci/authentication#organization-auth-token)
instead. Administrators can and have to revoke them as needed.
