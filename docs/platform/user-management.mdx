Organization Admins can add, remove, view and update members of their
organization on Memfault.

To see a list of users navigate to **Admin > Users**. This panel also allows you
to change the role of existing user accounts and remove users from your
organization.

To invite new users, navigate to **Admin > Invites**. Enter the name of the user
you want to invite, followed by a comma, space and their email address as shown
below. New users are added as **Member** by default. Users can be upgraded to
**Admin** after they accept their invite to join your organization.

If you are unable to view the **Admin** panel for your organization, this is
because your Memfault account is not an **Admin** account. Contact your
organization's administrator to change the role on your account. If you do not
know who your organization's administrator is, email us at support@memfault.com.

Note: users with role **Admin** will be able to:

1. Access the **Admin** panel for your organization
2. Update the roles of other users
3. Invite new users to your organization
4. Remove users from your organization
5. Create new projects for your organzation
6. Create new Organization Auth Tokens
7. Delete existing Organization Auth Tokens
