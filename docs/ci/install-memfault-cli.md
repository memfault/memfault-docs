The Memfault CLI tool is a simple command-line program which purpose is to make
integrations with the Memfault cloud from other systems, like continuous
integration servers, as easy as possible.

Under the hood, the tool acts as a client to [Memfault's HTTP API](/api).

The Memfault CLI tool is written in Python and published publicly in the
[Python Package Index (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/).

### Installing the Memfault CLI tool

To install it, make sure you have a recent version of Python 3.x installed.

:::tip
Use a
[virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)
to avoid conflicts with dependencies of other projects that use Python.
:::

Then run `pip3 install memfault-cli` to install it.

Once installed, the `memfault` command should be available in your shell:

```bash
$ memfault --help
Usage: memfault [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Options:
  --email TEXT        Account email to authenticate with
  --password TEXT     Account password or user API key to authenticate with
  --project-key TEXT  Memfault Project Key

  --project TEXT      Project slug
  --help              Show this message and exit.

```

### Example Usage: Uploading Firmware Symbols

:::caution
Uploading symbols requires your "User API Key". To locate the token
navigate to the "Settings" -> "General" page in the Memfault UI and copy/paste
the token in the "User API Key" section.
:::

```bash
$ memfault --email ${YOUR_EMAIL} --password ${YOUR_USER_API_KEY} \
  --org acme-inc \
  --project smart-sink \
   upload-symbols \
   --software-type stm32-fw \
   --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
   build/symbols.elf
```

:::note Tip
If you are going to be working with the same project you can add standard
arguments as environment variables to your shell init file or via the command
line:

```bash
$ export MEMFAULT_EMAIL=${YOUR_EMAIL}
$ export MEMFAULT_PASSWORD=${YOUR_USER_API_KEY}
$ export MEMFAULT_ORG=acme-inc
$ export MEMFAULT_PROJECT=smart-sink
```

With these changes, the invocation reduces to:

```bash
$ memfault upload-symbols \
  --hardware-version mp \
  --software-type stm32-fw \
  --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
  build/stm32-fw.bin

INFO: build/stm32-fw.bin: uploaded!
