In the following tutorial we will walk through how to post chunks directly to
the Memfault cloud using the `memfault` GDB commands included in the
[memfault-firmware-sdk](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk).

This is typically most helpful as a quick way to test that data collection is
working prior to implementing the
[data transport path](data-from-firmware-to-cloud.mdx).
