## Introduction

In order to process uploaded data, such as coredumps, Memfault needs to be able
to find the Symbol File (ELF) that corresponds to the software that produced the
uploaded data. Without an exact match, Memfault will not be able to decode the
uploaded data.

To that end, the SDK adds metadata to the uploaded data to identify the software
that produced the data. Likewise, any Symbol File that is uploaded to Memfault,
must have that same identifying metadata.

## Identifier Types

There are 3 types of identifiers:

|                                                    | Memfault Build Id | GNU Build Id | Software Type & Version |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Example                                            | `a1e688...`       | `a1e688...`  | `wifi-fw`/`1.0.0`       |
| Automatically generated hash                       | ✅                | ✅           |
| Manually chosen                                    |                   |              | ✅                      |
| Compiler requirement                               |                   | GNU/gcc      |                         |
| ID embedded inside ELF                             | ✅                | ✅           |
| ID passed manually upon Symbol File upload         |                   |              | ✅                      |
| Requires running Python script to post-process ELF | ✅                |              |
| Minimum SDK version                                | 0.20.0            | 0.20.0       |                         |

We recommend using either the Memfault Build Id or GNU Build Id option. The
Build Ids are automatically generated based on the contents of the ELF file.

Software Type & Version identifiers are manually assigned and therefore
error-prone.

:::tip

When uploading a Symbol File (ELF) that has a Build Id embedded, it is possible
to add a Software Type & Version based identifier, _in addition to the embedded
Build Id_. This will link the Symbol File with the Software Version. That way,
you can later look up and download the Symbol File by Software Version through
the Software Versions UI in Memfault.

Note that for the purpose of finding a Symbol File to match uploaded data, the
Build Id always takes precedence over Software Type & Version.

## Adding Build Ids

:::note

In order to use Build Ids for identification of Symbol Files & uploaded data,
SDK version 0.20.0 or newer is required.

## Uploading Symbol Files using Memfault CLI {#upload-symbol-files-cli}

Please follow
[the instructions to install the Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli)
first.

### Uploading Symbol File with Build Id

Because the Build Id is embedded inside the ELF file, the Build Id is
automatically recognized and extracted and does not need to be passed as an
argument to the `memfault` tool:

```bash
memfault --org-token $ORG_TOKEN --org acme-inc --project smart-sink \
  upload-mcu-symbols \
  build/symbols.elf
```

### Uploading Symbol File with Software Type & Version

To associate a Software Type & Software Version with a Symbol File, the
`--software-type` and `--software-version` arguments need to be passed to the
`memfault` tool.

Optionally, a `--revision` (Git commit hash, SVN revision, etc) can be passed as
well to store the version control revision in the newly created Software
Version.

```bash
memfault --org-token $ORG_TOKEN --org acme-inc --project smart-sink \
  upload-mcu-symbols \
  --software-type stm32-fw \
  --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
  --revision 89335ffade90ff7697e2ce5238bd4c68978b6d6e \
  build/symbols.elf
```
