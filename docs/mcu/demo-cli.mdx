Most reference implementations of the Memfault embedded SDK include a Command
Line Interface (CLI) demo app. The demo CLI lets you explore features of the SDK
components before integrating the SDK into your product. You might also find it
helpful to adapt the CLI to your product and use it to exercise your own
Memfault implementation.

This guide explains the commands available in the demo CLI and how to interpret
their output.

## Starting the CLI

The CLI runs on the embedded device itself and communicates with a host computer
over a communications interface. The interface varies depending on what is
available on the target but it will commonly be serial (UART), Segger RTT, or
semihosting. The `README` file for the reference implementation will explain the
interface and any steps needed to wire it up. The console works the same
regardless of the interface used.

The CLI is started with an [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) command similar to
this:

```
$ invoke NAME.console
```

Replace `NAME` with the name of the reference implementation. The `README` file
for the implementation will give the exact command. If the `invoke` command does
not halt with an error message, the console is active and can accept commands.

ℹ️ The `invoke` command does more than just pass through characters as a
terminal would. It actively listens to the connection and provides a special
feature used with the [`print_chunk`](#print_chunk) command that is described
below.

## Running a Command

The CLI displays a prompt to indicate it is ready to accept a command. To see if
the CLI is running, press enter and the prompt should be printed:

```
mflt>
```

To run a command, type its name and press enter. Try the `help` command to get
started.

## Command Reference

### `help`

The `help` command shows all available commands. Type `help` and press enter:

```
mflt> help
get_device_info: Get device info
crash: Trigger a crash
get_core: Get coredump info
clear_core: Clear an existing coredump
trace: Capture trace event
print_chunk: Get next Memfault data chunk to send and print as a curl command
help: Lists all commands
mflt>
```

Some reference implementations have more commands than others. For example, some
targets have network connectivity and can send data directly to the Memfault
cloud via the [`post_chunk`](#post_chunk) command. Devices without this ability
will not have that command.

### `get_device_info`

The `get_device_info` command shows the information configured in the reference
implementation's `memfault_platform_get_device_info()`:

```
mflt> get_device_info
MFLT: [INFO] S/N: 123456789012345678901234
MFLT: [INFO] SW type: NAME-main
MFLT: [INFO] SW version: 1.0.0
MFLT: [INFO] HW version: NAME-proto
mflt>
```

This information is sent to Memfault with any communications to identify the
device and the firmware it is running.

ℹ️ Remember to increment the software version (`SW version:` above) each time
you create a new build. Memfault uses the software version to associate a
coredump with its symbols. If you upload a coredump from a new build of the
firmware without updating the software version, the old symbols may be used and
the analysis on Memfault may not make sense.

### `crash`

The `crash` command causes the target the crash in various ways:

- `crash 0` or just `crash` causes a crash by `MEMFAULT_ASSERT(0)`
- `crash 1` causes a crash by jumping to a non-executable address (`0xbadcafe`)
- `crash 2` causes a crash by performing an unaligned memory store

The crash will be intercepted by the fault handler in the Memfault `panics`
component, a coredump will be generated and stored, and then the device
rebooted:

```
mflt> crash
MFLT: [INFO] Memfault demo app started...
mflt>
```

The demo CLI prints `Memfault demo app started...` whenever the device reboots.
If you do not see this message and the prompt return, then something may have
gone wrong in the fault handler. Another possibility is that a debugger is
attached and it is sitting on a breakpoint. The fault handler in most reference
implementations will break into the debugger if one is attached. In GDB, you
should be able to use `stepi` to resume, but see the `README` for the specific
reference implementation you are using in case it has other instructions.

Once the prompt has returned, the storage can be checked with the
[`get_core`](#get_core) command. It can then be cleared with
[`clear_core`](#clear_core) or read out of the coredump storage with
[`print_chunk`](#print_chunk).

⚠️ Once a coredump has been stored in the coredump storage, it will remain there
until either storage is cleared ([`clear_core`](#clear_core) command) or read
out ([`print_chunk`](#print_chunk) command). If you `crash` again without doing
one of these, saving the coredump will fail silently. The device will still
crash and reset but the existing coredump will not be overwritten.

### `get_core`

The `get_core` command displays the state of the coredump storage.

If a coredump is present in the coredump storage:

```
mflt> get_core
MFLT: [INFO] Has coredump with size: 20224
mflt>
```

If a coredump is not present:

```
mflt> get_core
MFLT: [INFO] No coredump present!
mflt>
```

Running `get_core` only displays information. It does not affect the state of
the coredump storage.

### `clear_core`

The `clear_core` command unconditionally invalidates the coredump storage so
that a new coredump can be stored:

```
mflt> clear_core
MFLT: [INFO] Invalidating coredump
mflt>
```

The `clear_core` command will show the same output regardless of whether a
coredump was present in the coredump storage or not.

### `trace`

The `trace` command captures a [trace event](trace-events.mdx) and writes it to
the event storage.

```
mflt> trace
mflt>
```

Once a trace has been captured, it can be read out of the event storage with the
[`print_chunk`](#print_chunk) command.

⚠️ The event storage is completely separate from the coredump storage. The
commands `get_core` and `clear_core` work only on the coredump storage. There
are no equivalents for the event storage.

### `print_chunk`

The `print_chunk` command reads out all data from both the coredump storage and
the event storage. It then formats this data into a
[chunk](data-from-firmware-to-cloud.mdx) that can be sent to the Memfault cloud.
Since not all devices have direct internet connectivity, `print_chunk` encodes
the chunk into shell command that sends it to Memfault using
[`curl`](https://curl.haxx.se/):

```
mflt> print_chunk
echo \
... \
| xxd -p -r | curl -X POST https://chunks.memfault.com/api/v0/chunks/xyz\
 -H 'Memfault-Project-Key:abc'\
 -H 'Content-Type:application/octet-stream' --data-binary @- -i
```

The `curl` command can be copy/pasted into a shell and run. However, if you are
running the demo CLI via the Invoke wrapper as recommended in this guide, you
should see this prompt:

```
Invoke CLI wrapper detected 'print_chunk' call
Would you like to run the command displayed above? [y/n]
```

The above prompt comes from your computer, not from the demo CLI running on the
target. The Invoke wrapper monitors all output from the demo CLI and when it
detects the output from the `print_chunk` command, it interrupts the session and
offers to run the `curl` command automatically.

After you accept (or decline) to run the `curl` command, the Invoke wrapper will
return you to your session with the demo CLI. If you don't see the `mflt>`
prompt, press enter and it should appear:

```
mflt>
```

⚠️ The `print_chunk` command has the side effect of clearing the data. After the
[packetizer](data-from-firmware-to-cloud.mdx) consumes the coredump storage and
the event storage, they will both be cleared and ready for new data.

⚠️ If the upload succeeds but you don't see the data processed on Memfault, go
to the Issues page and click on "Queue Status" to see the status of recent
uploads. You probably need to
[upload the symbols](uploading-software-versions.mdx).

### `post_chunk`

The `post_chunk` command is available on targets with direct network
connectivity:

```
mflt> post_chunk
Posting data to the Memfault cloud...
All data has been posted!
mflt>
```

It will read out all data from both the coredump storage and event storage and
then send the data directly to the Memfault cloud. The target must already be
configured on a network and be able to make an `HTTPS` connection to the
Memfault cloud servers. A valid Memfault project key must also be configured.
See the instructions in the reference implementation for how to do this.

⚠️ The `post_chunk` command has the side effect of clearing the data. After the
[packetizer](data-from-firmware-to-cloud.mdx) consumes the coredump storage and
the event storage, they will both be cleared and ready for new data.

⚠️ If the upload succeeds but you don't see the data processed on Memfault, you
probably need to [upload the symbols](uploading-software-versions.mdx).

  - [`post_chunk`](#post_chunk)
- Trace Events
  - [`trace`](#trace)
  - [`print_chunk`](#print_chunk)
  - [`post_chunk`](#post_chunk)

## Implementation Notes

The demo CLI itself is implemented as two components:

- `demo/memfault_demo_shell` implements the console. It handles character input
  and output, displaying the prompt, and dispatching the command to a C function
  in `memfault_demo_cli` that performs it. The demo shell is not used on all
  reference implementations. Some target platforms have a similar shell toolkit
  built-in. For those platforms, the built-in shell maybe used to call
  `memfault_demo_cli` functions directly.

- `demo/memfault_demo_cli` implements the actual demo. It has one function for
  each command on the CLI. Each function typically calls one function in the
  SDK, checks the result, and formats the output.
