In this guide we will walk through how to add some initial data collection
leveraging Memfault and verify that everything is working properly.

### Define First Trace Event

<DefineFirstTraceEvent />

### Define First Heartbeat

<DefineFirstHeartbeat />

### Add Test Commands to CLI

<AddCliTestCommands />

### Post data Locally

<PostChunksLocally />

### Upload Symbol File

<UploadSymbolFile />

### Troubleshooting Data Transfer

<DataTransferTroubleshooting />

### Next Steps

With data collection verified locally, the final step is sending the data
progamatically to the Memfault cloud.

<PublishDataToCloud />
