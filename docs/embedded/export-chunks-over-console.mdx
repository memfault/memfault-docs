In the following tutorial we will discuss how to use the Memfault SDK data
export API to collect "chunks" from a device and then post them to the Memfault
cloud for analysis.

### Add call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`

The data export module uses the SDK data
[packetizer APIs](https://mflt.io/data-to-cloud) to read the data which has been
collected. It then base64 encode it and dump the result to a destination of your
choosing.

First you will need to find a location in your project to trigger the export
such as a code path that runs periodically or on-demand via a user triggered
action such as a CLI command.

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_export.h"

void some_periodic_task_or_cli_cmd(void) {
  memfault_data_export_dump_chunks()
}
```

<summary> Optional: Override where data is exported to </summary>

By default, the data_export module will dump results to the console using the
`memfault_platform_log` implementation that was added as part of the
[initial integration](/docs/embedded/introduction#getting-started).

However, the location can be overriden so data can be published elsewhere (i.e
directly to a file):

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_export.h"

void memfault_data_export_base64_encoded_chunk(const char *chunk_str) {
   user_export_write_string_to_file(chunk_str);
}
```

</details>

### Grab Project Key from Memfault UI

A Project key will be needed in order to communicate with Memfault's web
services. Go to [https://app.memfault.com/](https://app.memfault.com/), navigate
to the project you want to use and select 'Settings'â†’'General'. The 'Project
Key' listed is what you will want to use.
