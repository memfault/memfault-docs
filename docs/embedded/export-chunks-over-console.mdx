:::caution

This guide assumes you have already installed the
[Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli).

:::

In the following tutorial we will discuss how to use the Memfault SDK data
export API to collect "chunks" from a device and then post them to the Memfault
cloud for analysis.

## Add call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`

The data export module uses the SDK data
[packetizer APIs](https://mflt.io/data-to-cloud) to read the data which has been
collected. It then base64 encode it and dump the result to a destination of your
choosing.

First you will need to find a location in your project to trigger the export
such as a code path that runs periodically or on-demand via a user triggered
action such as a CLI command.

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_export.h"

void some_periodic_task_or_cli_cmd(void) {
  memfault_data_export_dump_chunks()
}
```

## Optional: Override where data is exported to

By default, the data_export module will dump results to the console using the
`memfault_platform_log` implementation that was added as part of the
[initial integration](/docs/embedded/introduction#getting-started).

However, the location can be overriden so data can be published elsewhere (i.e
directly to a file):

```c
#include "memfault/core/data_export.h"

void memfault_data_export_base64_encoded_chunk(const char *chunk_str) {
   user_export_write_string_to_file(chunk_str);
}
```

## Save extracted data to file

Now that you have wired up the export facilities, generate some Memfault data,
trigger a data export, and save it to a file.

You should see strings with the format: `MC:BASE64_ENCODED_CHUNK:` in the dump.

:::note

It's perfectly fine for other logs to be interleaved with the exported data.

Here's an example of some
[Precanned Data Payloads](/docs/embedded/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint) that
I've saved to
[test-pattern-data-export.txt](/downloads/docs/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint/test-pattern-data-export.txt)
from a dump over a console:

```
[00:00:01] INFO: System Booting!
[00:00:02] DEBUG: System Initialized

[00:00:35] DEBUG: Etc ...
```

## Grab Project Key from Memfault UI

A Project key will be needed in order to communicate with Memfault's web
services. Go to [https://app.memfault.com/](https://app.memfault.com/), navigate
to the project you want to use and select 'Settings'â†’'General'. The 'Project
Key' listed is what you will want to use.

## Post Data to Memfault Cloud using CLI Tool

Now that you have collected some data, you can post it to the Memfault cloud by
using the [Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli).

```bash
$ memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding sdk_data_export test-pattern-data-export.txt
Found 2 Chunks. Sending Data ...
Success
```

At this point you can navigate back to the Memfault UI and view the data that
has been sent!
