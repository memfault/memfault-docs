Memfault has a few architecture specific dependencies that need to be implemented.

```c
//! @file memfault_platform_port.c

#include "memfault/components.h"

void memfault_platform_halt_if_debugging(void) {
  // This is called when a crash takes place. Can be left blank or
  // special action can be taken such as issuing a breakpoint instruction
}

bool memfault_arch_is_inside_isr(void) {
   // Only needs to be implemented if Memfault APIs will be called from ISRs
   return false;
}
```
