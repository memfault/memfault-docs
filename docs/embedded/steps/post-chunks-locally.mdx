Prior to having an end-to-end transport in place, Memfault data can be exported
over any serial connection or via GDB directly.

:::note

This strategy can also be used even when an end-to-end transport is in place for
local QA testing or in CI/CD test automation setups.

#### Prerequisite: Project Key from Memfault UI

A Project key will be needed in order to communicate with Memfault's web
services. Go to [https://app.memfault.com/](https://app.memfault.com/), navigate
to the project you want to use and select 'Settings'â†’'General'. The 'Project
Key' listed is what you will want to use.

#### Post Chunks To Memfault

All data collected by Memfault can be exported as opaque packets called
"chunks". To trigger an export, call the `test_export` command added to your
device CLI or add a periodic call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks` in your
code.
