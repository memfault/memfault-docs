Prior to having an end-to-end transport in place, Memfault data can be exported
over any serial connection or via GDB directly.

:::note

This strategy can also be used even when an end-to-end transport is in place for
local QA testing or in CI/CD test automation setups.

:::

#### Export Data to Console

To test it out, call the `test_export` command added to your CLI above:

```
shell> reboot
[00:00:01] INFO: System Booting!
[00:00:02] INFO: Memfault Build ID: d8d6a047282f025fffa29fa767100f310bc40f80
shell> trace
# CLI command making a call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`
shell> export
[00:00:10] INFO: MC:SFQCpwIBAwEHalRFU1RTRVJJQUwKbXRlc3Qtc29mdHdhcmUJajEuMC4wLXRlcw==:
//...
```

#### Upload data using Memfault CLI tool

Data can be exported locally in two ways:

- [via Console](/docs/embedded/export-chunks-over-console)
- [via GDB](/docs/embedded/test-data-collection-with-gdb)
