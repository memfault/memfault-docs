Prior to having an end-to-end transport in place, Memfault data can be exported
over any serial connection or via GDB directly.

#### Post Chunks To Memfault

All data collected by Memfault can be exported as opaque packets called
"chunks". To trigger an export, call the `test_export` command added to your
device CLI.

<PostChunksWithMemfaultUI />

#### (Optional) Automate Chunk Posting

Posting chunks from a local setup can be automated using our CLI tool or GDB
script.

:::note

This strategy can also be used even when an end-to-end transport is in place for
local QA testing or in CI/CD test automation setups.
