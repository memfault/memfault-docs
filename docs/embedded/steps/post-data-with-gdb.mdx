### Prerequisites

- You need to have a way to debug your product with GDB as part of your
  development setup
- The GDB version you are using needs to have the
  [GDB Python API enabled](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/automate-debugging-with-gdb-python-api#getting-started-with-gdb-python).
  (It's generally the default or there is a `-py` version of GDB which has it
  included.)
- You need to compile your firmware with debug symbol information (i.e `-g`
  CFLAG)

:::note

Even if you are using other compilers such as ARMCC or IAR, you can load the ELF
(.out, .elf) generated and debug it in GDB as well.

:::

### Launch GDB and connect debugger

For example:

```
$ arm-none-eabi-gdb-py my_app.elf --ex="target remote :3333"
(gdb)
```

### Load Memfault GDB script

Copy and paste and run the following in gdb:

```bash
python exec('try:\n from urllib2 import urlopen\nexcept:\n from urllib.request import urlopen'); exec(urlopen('https://mflt.io/memfault-gdb-script').read())
```

:::tip

Some GDB versions do not support Python scripting by default. If you see a
message like "Python scripting is not supported in this copy of GDB", you might
be able to run an alternative GDB binary with a -py suffix, for example
arm-none-eabi-gdb-py.

:::

### Register Handler

Copy the command below and paste it into GDB and hit enter. This will load a
handler which automatically posts data to Memfault whenever
`memfault_data_export_dump_chunks` is called.

```bash
memfault install_chunk_handler --verbose --project-key <YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>
```

### Try It Out!

Now, every time `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks` is called, the data passed as
a parameter to the function will automatically be posted to the Memfault cloud.
You don't have to do anything else! You will see logs print in the gdb CLI as
data is posted:

```bash
(gdb) Continuing.
Successfully posted 45 bytes of chunk data
Successfully posted 53 bytes of chunk data
[...]
```
