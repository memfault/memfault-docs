### Install the Python Memfault CLI Tool

The [Memfault Desktop CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli). tool is written
in Python and published publicly in the
[Python Package Index (pypi)](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/).

To install it, make sure you have a recent version of Python 3.x installed and
run:

```bash
$ pip3 install memfault-cli
$ memfault --help
```

### Save device logs to file

Start your console with your favorite terminal client. Let the system run for a
bit, periodically dumping data to the console by calling
`memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`.

You should see strings with the format: `MC:BASE64_ENCODED_CHUNK:` in the dump.

:::note

It's perfectly fine for other logs to be interleaved with the exported data.

:::

For example:

```
shell> reboot
[00:00:01] INFO: System Booting!
[00:00:02] INFO: Memfault Build ID: d8d6a047282f025fffa29fa767100f310bc40f80
shell> trace
# CLI command making a call to `memfault_data_export_dump_chunks`
shell> export
[00:00:10] INFO: MC:SFQCpwIBAwEHalRFU1RTRVJJQUwKbXRlc3Qtc29mdHdhcmUJajEuMC4wLXRlcw==:
```

Save the resulting logs to a file such as logs.txt

### Post chunks from logs with Memfault CLI

Run the desktop Memfault CLI tool on your saved log file. The utility will parse
the logs, extract the Memfault data, and post it here for processing!

```bash
$ memfault --project-key ${YOUR_PROJECT_KEY} post-chunk --encoding sdk_data_export logs.txt
Found 2 Chunks. Sending Data ...
Success
```
