If you encounter any issues in your data transfer implementation, Memfault has tools to help debug!

- A UI you can use to
  [view the raw "Chunk" data payloads](/docs/embedded/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint#troubleshooting)
  that have arrived for your project.
- [Precanned Data Payloads](/docs/embedded/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint)
  you can pass through your `user_transport_send_chunk_data()` implementation to
  test data transfer in isolation.
- A [GDB Script](/docs/embedded/test-data-collection-with-gdb) which can be
  installed to send chunks programatically every time a breakpoint is hit.
