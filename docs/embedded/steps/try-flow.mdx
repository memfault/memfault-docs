If you do not use GDB, skip ahead to the next step.

If you use GDB, a full coredump can be captured by just using the debugger! This
can be useful during development to take advanatge of Memfault's analyzers when
a device crashes or hangs.

To perform the capture, navigate to http://app.memfault.com/ and select the
"Issues" page in the Memfault UI, click on the "Manual Upload" button, and click
on "walk-through on how to upload your first core dump". From there you can
follow the guided steps to perform a capture. At the end you will see an
analysis of your system state.
