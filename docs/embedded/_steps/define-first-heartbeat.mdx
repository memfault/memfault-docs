Heartbeat metrics allow you to easily monitor your platform and confirm it is
operating as expected.

<details>

<summary>Typical Heartbeat Examples</summary>

- investigate problems that didn't cause a reboot (bad connectivity, network or
  sensor error rates) and marginality that crops up in a fleet
- providing leading indicators of problems (rapid battery drain, drop in
  activity, etc)
- compare trends across releases (improved connectivity, data efficiency etc)

Best Practices around each metric type that we recommend:

- Timers - These are used to track time spent in particular states and can be
  used for debugging connectivity, battery life, and performance issues.
- Counters - Track counts of a particular event class taking place. Suggested
  use cases are:
  - Operations your system are performing (number of events serviced by a task,
    bytes sent over network, bytes written to flash). Alerts can be configured
    to identify devices operating outside normal thresholds.
  - Counts of events for events that should never happen (i2c bus write error
    count, flash write error). You can alert if any of these situations are
    seen.
- Gauges - These are values sampled at the end of each heartbeat interval.
  Common items include
  - Battery Metrics (Drop over an hour, current percent)
  - Heap utilization / stack high watermark

#### Add Metric to memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def

```c
//! @file memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(MainTaskWakeups, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned)
```

#### Instrument Code to Update Heartbeat

```c
voit my_main_task(void) {
   while (1) {
      your_rtos_wait_for_event();
      memfault_metrics_heartbeat_add(
        MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(MainTaskWakeups), 1);
   }
}
```
