There are many reasons a device may reboot in the field â€” whether it be due to a
crash, a brown out, or a firmware update.

Within the Memfault UI, reboot events are displayed for each device as well as
summarized in the main "Overview" dashboard:

In this guide we will walk through how to use the
[reboot tracking](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/components/include/memfault/core/reboot_tracking.h#L9-L21)
module from the memfault-firmware-sdk to collect this data.

### Overview

The reboot tracking module utilizes a noinit region of RAM to track information
about reboots across resets.

- If a MCU fault takes place, the fault reason will automatically be tracked
- If the device reboots and the reason is not known, the device reset reason
  will be derived from the MCU reset reason register that was part of your
  initial port.

### Tracking custom reset reasons

Sometimes resets take place due to software initiated behavior (i.e firmware
update, button resets, etc). Recording when and where these types of resets take
place can easily be achieved with Memfault's
`memfault_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent` API. For example, consider we
want to track anytime a reset occurs due to an over-the-air update:

```c
#include "memfault/components.h"

// [...]

void ota_finalize_and_reboot(void) {
  // The pc & lr which result in the reboot can always be *optionally* recorded
  void *pc;
  MEMFAULT_GET_PC(pc);
  void *lr;
  MEMFAULT_GET_LR(lr);
  sMfltRebootTrackingRegInfo reg_info = {
    .pc = (uint32_t)pc,
    .lr = (uint32_t)lr,
  };
  // Note: "reg_info" may be NULL if no register information collection is desired
  memfault_reboot_tracking_mark_reset_imminent(kMfltRebootReason_FirmwareUpdate,
                                               &reg_info);
  // [... logic to reboot the MCU ...]
}
```
